# Florida Motorcyles Endorsements 2009 through 2023

## Overview

This is a project that ocurred to me, while looking up information on titling my bike, before moving to Florida, as being a fun way to apply what I'd been learning. What sparked it was a curious entry on the motorcycle endorsements table that I've mentioned below, in the Notes.

To make the project statistically more interesting, I've also added population information for the counties, state of Florida, and the USA.

## Notes

Highlands county had a remarkable increase in endorsements in 2016; this seems like a data entry error. This is also the reason for pursuing this project.

The last year that motorcycle endorsements were recorded for OOS (out of state?) on the referenced table was 2011. Since OOS isn't a county, on top of it being very lacking in statistical information, it was discarded.

I have no idea what Unknown is supposed to be -- it's certainly not a county in Florida (though it would be a pretty amusing name). Were the drivers able to get endorsements without being assigned to a county? I also left this row out.

However, endorsements are endorsements, so I left the totals. I'm guessing what used to be OOS was grouped with Unknown after 2011. These together, along with the county endorsements, make up Florida endorsements for each year. Someone looking closely might wonder "Where are the ten to twenty thousand unaccounted or endorsements per year coming from?" Now, you know.
